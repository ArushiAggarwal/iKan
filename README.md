# iKan

Hey Judges, 
iKan is an app to connect disabled children so they feel secure and welcomed in their environment. This app is a one stop shop that aids these families in navigating the obstacles that come along in their data to day life.

How to run the app: 

Dependencies: 
OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
New to Xcode? Download it from the Mac App Store.
Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
New to node or npm? brew install node
We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug. brew install watchman
If you want to use flow, brew install flow

Running the app: 
Once you have the repo cloned and met all the requirements above, start the packager that will transform your JS code on-the-fly:
npm install
npm start
Open iKan in Xcode.
Make sure you have an iOS simulator selected to run the app.
Build and run the project with the Xcode run button.
You should now see the Movies app running on your iOS simulator. Congratulations! You've just successfully run your first React Native app.
